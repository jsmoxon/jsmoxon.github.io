I really enjoy writing. I built an <a href="http://www.blockr.me">app</a> to get more people writing daily. 
<br/><br/>

My favorite writing on writing might be Paul Graham <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html">essay on essays</a>. The takeaway: the word “essay" comes from the French word “essayer" which means “to try”. Essays are an attempt to answer a question.
<br/><br/>

I write to warm up my thinking rather than to present definitive conclusions. A brilliant example of this is David Foster Wallace’s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/11/just-asking/306288/">Just Asking</a>.
<br/><br/>

My friend’s sister is a writer and she sees writing the way many of us view exercise. If she goes a day or two without writing, she feels sluggish and lethargic. I’m starting to feel that way too.
<br/><br/>

I care what you think about me as a writer, but I am trying to fight that by publishing here despite feeling self-conscious about it. 
<br/><br/>

I am not using a blogging platform because it’s kind of fun and whimsical to go and edit the HTML for each post. I’m toying with removing all the CSS too but I won’t subject you to that. 
<br/><br/>

<a href="http://www.tiger-town.com/whatnot/updike/">Here</a> are three <a href="http://lumpy-pudding.tumblr.com/post/105221369/the-shrinking-lonesome-sestina-miller-williams">examples</a> of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10554/10554-h/10554-h.htm">writing</a> I love.
